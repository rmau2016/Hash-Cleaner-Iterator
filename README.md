# Hash Cleaner and Iterator
This Python Script will extract all Md5 hashes or SHA1 hashes in a file of choice and the emails with the corresponding hash.

Examine.py : For r_file put in the database file location, for w_file put the directory and file you want to append.
Will update for other hashes choices and salts.
Iterator mode will cross reference two files... one with [HASH:EMAIL] and the other would be [HASH:PASSWORD] to result [EMAIL:PASSWORD]
